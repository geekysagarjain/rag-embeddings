Learning Vector Databases for RAG with Pinecone

This repository documents my hands-on journey into Vector Databases and their role in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using Pinecone. It includes experiments, code samples, and notes on embedding generation, similarity search, and integrating with LLMs for enhanced context-aware responses.
Ideal for anyone exploring how to combine semantic search with LLMs in real-world applications.
